## 🚀 How it Works (Automatic)

### ✅ **GOOD NEWS: It's Mostly Automatic!**

- **Stops automatically** when you log out
- **Pauses automatically** when you switch to other tabs/apps
- **Resumes automatically** when you come back to CRM

### 📱 **What You'll See**
In the top navigation bar, you'll see a timer widget showing:
- ⏱️ **Today's Time**: "2h 30m" (your total time today)
- 🟢 **Status**: "Active" or "Paused"
- ⏸️ **Manual Controls**: Pause/Resume buttons
