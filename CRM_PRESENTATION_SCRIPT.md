### **SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM**
**Duration**: 3 minutes

**Script**:
"Let's start by understanding the problems with current CRM solutions. I'm sure many of you have experienced these challenges firsthand.

**First, they're extremely expensive.** Salesforce costs â‚¹15,000 to â‚¹50,000 per month. HubSpot charges â‚¹8,000 to â‚¹25,000 per month. For a growing business, these costs are simply unsustainable.

**Second, they take forever to set up.** Most CRMs require 3-6 months for implementation. That's half a year of delays, complex configurations, and expensive consultants. Your business can't afford to wait that long.

**Third, they're not designed for Indian businesses.** They lack GST compliance, don't support UPI payments, and have generic workflows that don't match Indian business processes.

**Finally, they don't include payment processing.** You need separate systems for invoicing, payment collection, and tracking. This creates manual work, delays, and errors.

These problems cost your business time, money, and opportunities. But what if there was a better solution?"

**Key Points**:
- Identify pain points
- Use specific numbers
- Create emotional connection
- Transition to solution
