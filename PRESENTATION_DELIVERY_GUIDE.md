## ðŸŽ¤ **Presentation Delivery Script**

### **Opening (2 minutes)**
"Good morning/afternoon everyone! Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today. I'm [Your Name] from Traincape Technology, and I'm excited to show you how our CRM can transform your business operations and drive significant revenue growth.

Today, I'll be presenting 'Traincape CRM' - India's most affordable, complete CRM solution with built-in payment processing. By the end of this presentation, you'll understand how we can help you save 80% on CRM costs while improving your business efficiency by 300%."

### **Problem Statement (3 minutes)**
"Let's start by understanding the problems with current CRM solutions. I'm sure many of you have experienced these challenges firsthand.

**First, they're extremely expensive.** Salesforce costs â‚¹15,000 to â‚¹50,000 per month. HubSpot charges â‚¹8,000 to â‚¹25,000 per month. For a growing business, these costs are simply unsustainable.

**Second, they take forever to set up.** Most CRMs require 3-6 months for implementation. That's half a year of delays, complex configurations, and expensive consultants. Your business can't afford to wait that long.

**Third, they're not designed for Indian businesses.** They lack GST compliance, don't support UPI payments, and have generic workflows that don't match Indian business processes.

**Finally, they don't include payment processing.** You need separate systems for invoicing, payment collection, and tracking. This creates manual work, delays, and errors.

These problems cost your business time, money, and opportunities. But what if there was a better solution?"

### **Solution Overview (2 minutes)**
"Introducing Traincape CRM - the complete business solution that solves all these problems.

**We're ready in 1 week, not 6 months.** Our streamlined setup process gets you up and running quickly, with no complex configuration required.

**We save you 80% on costs.** Our pricing starts at just â‚¹2,999 per month, compared to â‚¹15,000-50,000 for competitors. That's a massive cost savings that goes straight to your bottom line.

**We're built for Indian businesses.** GST compliance is built-in, we support UPI and all Indian payment methods, and our workflows match Indian business processes.

**And most importantly, payment processing is included.** No more separate systems - everything is integrated and automated.

But don't just take my word for it. Let me show you exactly what we offer."

### **Feature Deep Dive (8 minutes)**
"Traincape CRM is a complete business solution, not just a CRM. Let me walk you through our comprehensive feature set.

**Sales Management** includes lead management and scoring, sales pipeline and forecasting, customer relationship management, and deal tracking with advanced analytics.

**Payment Processing** is where we really shine. We include full Stripe integration, professional invoicing, automatic payment tracking, and multi-currency support - all built-in.

**Employee Management** covers HR and payroll, attendance tracking, leave management, and performance analytics.

**And everything is mobile-first.** Our responsive web app works perfectly on all devices, with offline capability and push notifications.

This isn't just a CRM - it's your complete business operating system."

### **ROI & Cost Savings (3 minutes)**
"Now let's talk about the numbers - the ROI and cost savings that make Traincape CRM an obvious choice.

**The cost comparison is dramatic.** Salesforce costs â‚¹15,000 to â‚¹50,000 per month. HubSpot charges â‚¹8,000 to â‚¹25,000. Zoho costs â‚¹4,000 to â‚¹15,000. We start at just â‚¹2,999 per month.

**That's annual savings of â‚¹1.44 lakhs to â‚¹4.44 lakhs compared to Salesforce.** Even compared to Zoho, you save â‚¹12,000 to â‚¹24,000 per year.

**But the real value comes from business impact.** Our clients see 40% faster lead response times, 25% higher conversion rates, 60% time savings on invoicing, and 30% increase in sales.

**Let me show you a real example.** If you're currently spending â‚¹5 lakhs per year on CRM and related tools, and you switch to Traincape CRM, you'll save â‚¹3.5 lakhs annually while improving your business performance. That's a 455% ROI in the first year alone."
