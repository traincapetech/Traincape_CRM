## 🎤 **Interview Questions & Answers**

### **Technical Questions:**

#### **Q1: Explain the overall architecture of your CRM system.**
**Answer:** 
"The CRM system follows a modern three-tier architecture:
- **Frontend:** React with Vite for fast development, using Context API for state management
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js providing RESTful APIs and Socket.IO for real-time features
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas for scalable document storage

The system uses JWT for authentication, Socket.IO for real-time chat, and is deployed on cloud platforms for high availability."

#### **Q2: How did you implement real-time chat functionality?**
**Answer:**
"I implemented real-time chat using Socket.IO:
- **Client-side:** React context manages socket connection and chat state
- **Server-side:** Socket.IO handles room-based messaging with user authentication
- **Features:** Real-time messaging, typing indicators, user presence, offline message storage
- **Guest support:** Non-registered users can chat without authentication
- **Scalability:** Room-based architecture ensures messages reach only intended recipients"

#### **Q3: How do you handle authentication and authorization?**
**Answer:**
"The system uses JWT-based authentication with role-based access control:
- **Authentication:** Users login with credentials, server validates and returns JWT token
- **Authorization:** Middleware checks token validity and user roles for protected routes
- **Security:** Passwords hashed with bcrypt, tokens expire after 30 days
- **Frontend:** Token stored in localStorage, automatically included in API requests
- **Roles:** Five distinct roles with different access levels (Admin, Manager, Sales Person, Lead Person, Customer)"
